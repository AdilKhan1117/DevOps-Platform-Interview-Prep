What is a container?
- A way to package application with all the necessary dependencies and configuration
- Portable standardized artifact for development, shipment and deployment.
- Makes development and deployment more efficient.

Docker Image vs Docker Container:
Docker Image:
- The actual package (file)
- Artifact that can be moved around
- Not in "running" state
- Consists of several layers
- Mostly Linux Base Image, application, image on top.

Docker Container:
- Actually starts the application
- Is a running environment defined in the image
- Virtual file system
- Port binding: talk to application running


What is the difference between a Container vs VM Image? 

- Size: Docker Imagemuch smaller
- Speed: Dockercontainers start and run much faster
- Compatibility: VM ofany OS can run on anyOS host

Container:
Abstraction at the app layer
Multiple containers share the OS kernel

Virtual Machines:
Abstraction of physical hardware
Each VM includes a full copy of an OS
